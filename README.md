# crud-app-homework

1. Create a crud app for pets, which has a schema that contains at least four properties

2. Create a github repo for the application
	- make commits after you get something working
	- start small, start with getting your server running
	- then get the views and routes working
	- then intergrate the db

3. Use your fruits app as a reference

4. Google your errors, and think about what function is being run when you encounter an error

5. The final product should have the same functionality as the fruits app

6. Don't copy and paste the code, write is so you are developing your muscle memory

7. Share your github link in slack when you are finished
